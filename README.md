# PIC16F877A Temperature and Humidity Measurement Project 🌡️💧

This project uses the PIC16F877A microcontroller to measure temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and display the readings on a 16x2 LCD.

## Features
- Supports DHT11 / SHT21 sensors
- Displays data on a 16x2 LCD
- Uses I2C communication (optional, if using I2C LCD)
- Written in CCS C
- Includes Proteus simulation files

## Hardware Requirements
- PIC16F877A microcontroller
- DHT11 or SHT21 temperature and humidity sensor
- 16x2 LCD (with or without I2C module)
- 10K potentiometer (for LCD contrast adjustment)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
